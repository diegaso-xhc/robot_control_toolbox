# Robot Control Toolbox

## Overview of the repository

<div align="justify">
Human hands are the sought-after end effector, because of their high performance and remarkable flexibility. Emulating and embedding human hand capabilities into robotic grasping is crucial to further advance the object manipulation field. State-of-the-art robot hands allow the exertion of grasps which can be leveraged to accomplish complex tasks (e.g. in hand manipulation scenarios). Among these state-of-the-art robotic hands is the <a href="https://www.prensilia.com/ih2-azzurra-hand/">ih2 azzurra hand</a> developed by <a href="https://www.prensilia.com/">Prensilia</a>. This hand offers 5 degrees of actuation with 11 degrees of freedom. Additionally, the hand allows position, current, velocity, and force control on its fringers. Since interacting with this robotic hand is not intuitive at first, this repository provides some ready to use functionalities that can be used to build more complex actions.
